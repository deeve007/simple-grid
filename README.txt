	
	SIMPLE GRID - HOW IT WORKS
	
	---------------------------------------------------------

	.container

	Add this class to your page wrapper to center it to the 
	browser window and set the width of the page.

	.row

	Add this class to any element that spans the entire width 
	of your container to clear any floating child elements. 
	Also allows you to define spacing between rows.

	.col

	Add this class to child elements of a row to float left 
	and add the default gutter width. This class must be 
	used in conjuction with one of the span classes below.

	.span_1, .span_2, .span_3, .span_4, .span_5, .span_6, 
	.span_7, .span_8, .span_9, .span_10, .span_11, .span_12

	Add one of these classes to a each col element to set it's 
	fluid width. On smaller screen sizes these elements will 
	default to stack vertically.
